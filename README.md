# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning  

Stock price prediction plays a crucial role in financial markets, enabling investors to make informed decisions. Due to the volatile and complex nature of stock price movements, machine learning and deep learning models are widely employed for forecasting.  

This project aims to analyze historical stock prices and develop a predictive model to forecast future trends using **Maruti Suzuki stock data**.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
For this study, we used the **Maruti Suzuki stock dataset** sourced from the **NIFTY-50 Stock Market Data (2000 - 2021)**.  

### ✅ Objectives:  
- Analyze stock price trends through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and scaling the data.  
- Implement multiple models for stock price forecasting:
  - **XGBoost**  
  - **LSTM**  
  - **Decision Tree**  
  - **Random Forest**  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** and **R² score**.  
- Identify the best-performing model based on accuracy and consistency.

## 🧪 Models Implemented  
1. **XGBoost** – Gradient boosting model that works well with structured data.  
2. **LSTM** – Long Short-Term Memory model effective for sequential data and long-term dependencies.  
3. **Decision Tree** – Rule-based model that splits data based on feature importance.  
4. **Random Forest** – Ensemble model combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.  

---

## 📈 Results  
- The **LSTM model** achieved the highest accuracy, effectively capturing long-term dependencies and complex patterns in the data.  
- Performance Metrics:  
    - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**  
    - **R² Score**
